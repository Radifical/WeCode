	<h1> Introduction to HTML </h1>
	<p> HTML stands hypertext markup language. It is a computer markup language primarily used for making webpages. In this
		article, I will go over the basics of creating an HTML webpage. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The first thing you should do to begin your HTML websitr is go to glitch.com and create an account. Once you are logged in, create a new hello website project and go to the index.html file. Now you can begin coding!</p>
	<br>
	<p> Let's add our first element to the webpage. at the top of your file, type < h1 > and < / h1 >. In between the two, you can write a heading for your website. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The next element of your webpage should be a p tag. The p stands for paragraph. You can creat this by writing < p > and < / p > and writing your paragraph in between them. </p>
  <br>
  <p> If you want to add a break between your paragraph and the next page element, you would need to write < b >. Unlike most things in HTML, br does not require a closing tag. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Next on your page you can add an image. You would do this by writing < img href = "imgLink.com" >. Like br, img does not require a closing tag. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Congratulations! You have now created your first HTML webpage! If you want to make your page fancy with some CSS, you can create a css file or use < style > tags. Be sure to check out our Introduction to CSS article for more information on that. </p>
